# Covid-19 Data Exploration

This repository contains SQL code for exploring and analyzing Covid-19 data. The code utilizes various SQL techniques and functions to extract insights from the dataset. The project focuses on the "COVID-19 dataset" database.

## Features

The project includes the following SQL queries and views:

1. **Query 1: Selecting Non-Null Data, Sorted by Columns**
   - Retrieves all non-null data from the "CovidDeaths$" table, sorted by specific columns.

2. **Query 2: Initial Data Selection**
   - Selects key data points from the "CovidDeaths$" table, providing an overview of location, date, cases, deaths, and population.

3. **Query 3: Percentage of Deaths among Total Cases in Egypt**
   - Calculates the percentage of deaths among total cases in Egypt over time.

4. **Query 4: Percentage of Population Infected with Covid in Egypt**
   - Calculates the percentage of the population infected with Covid in Egypt over time.

5. **Query 5: Countries with the Highest Infection Rate**
   - Identifies countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population.

6. **Query 6: Countries with Highest Death Count per Population**
   - Selects countries with the highest death count per population.

7. **Query 7: Global Covid Statistics by Day**
   - Calculates global Covid statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentage, on a daily basis.

8. **Query 8: Global Covid Statistics**
   - Provides an overall summary of global Covid statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.

9. **Query 9: Total Population vs Vaccinations**
   - Analyzes the percentage of the population that received at least one Covid vaccine over time.

10. **Query 10: Using CTE to Perform Calculation on Partitioned Data**
    - Utilizes a Common Table Expression (CTE) to perform calculations on partitioned data.

11. **Query 11: Using Temp Table to Perform Calculation on Partitioned Data**
    - Utilizes a temporary table to perform calculations on partitioned data.

12. **View 1: CovidSummaryStats**
    - View that calculates Covid summary statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.

13. **View 2: GlobalCovidStats**
    - View that calculates global Covid statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.

14. **View 3: PercentPopulationVaccinated**
    - View that calculates the number of vaccinated people per location over time.
